## About the Project

**ARTEH CMS 25** is a content management system built from scratch with a focus on:

- clean and readable code,
- self-made solutions instead of ready-made frameworks,
- a monolithic architecture designed for future growth and expansion.

The project serves both as a functional tool for publishing content and as a development sandbox for testing new concepts, techniques, and programming approaches.
